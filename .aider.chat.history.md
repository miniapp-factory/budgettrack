#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

To update the app’s title and description and generate a new logo, I’ll need to edit the metadata file and create a new logo‑generation file.

**Files that need to be added to the chat:**

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to modify the `title` and `description` constants.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to create the logo‑generation instruction file.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
